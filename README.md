# PantryPal-Server

### Projects purpose:
This backend uses the superset TypeScript to be more type-safe and robust. With the help of TypeScript the user can now search queries, sign in, sign up and save recipes to their grocerylist.

### Planning:
Rough layout and logical mindmap was constructed in Excalidraw to easen the projects scope and to make an clear overhead view what needs to be done and what to consider skipping.

The project is going to be a recipe app that helps the user to save recipes into a grocerylist and then displays it once the user is in the store and can remove one item at the time.

### Frontend:

### What I've learned:
queries: How to implement them to a project, and what purpose they fill in a search function.
<br>
morgan: Package that helps the developer to affirm that certain CRUD-requests made it to the server.
<br>
envalid: Package that helps the user to remove 'process' from each variable saved in .env since it types it in validateEnv in /utils.
<br>
httpError: Package that helps the user and the developer to give more accurate error messages, incase of errors.
