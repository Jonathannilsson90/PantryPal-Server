# PantryPal-Server

### Projects purpose:
PantryPal-Server is the backend component of the PantryPal recipe app. It utilizes TypeScript for enhanced type safety and robustness. This backend allows users to perform search queries, sign in, sign up, and save recipes to their grocery list.

### Planning:
Rough layout and logical mindmap was constructed in Excalidraw to easen the projects scope and to make an clear overhead view what key components was needed for the entire project to function.


## Features:
- <b>Recipe saving:</b> Users can save recipes to their own grocerylist tab.
- <b>Search Queries:</b> Lets the users search for their favorite recipe with ease!
- <b>User Authentication:</b> Supports user sign-in and sign up.


### The app:

### Learning highlights:
- <b>Queries:</b> How to implement them to a project, and what purpose they fill in a search function.
- <b>Morgan:</b> Package that helps the developer to affirm that certain CRUD-requests made it to the server.
- <b>Envalid:</b> Package that helps the user to remove 'process' from each variable saved in .env since it types it in validateEnv in /utils.
- <b>HttpError:</b> Package that helps the user and the developer to give more accurate error messages, incase of errors.
