# PantryPal-Server

## Projects purpose:
In this project we were tasked to build an app with CRUD functionality in React Native with the help of the Expo framework.

## Planning:
Rough layout and logical mindmap was constructed in Excalidraw to easen the projects scope and to make an clear overhead view what needs to be done and what to consider skipping.

The project is going to be a recipe app that helps the user to save recipes into a grocerylist and then displays it once the user is in the store and can remove one item at the time.
